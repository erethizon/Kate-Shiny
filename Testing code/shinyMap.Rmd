title: "Shiny Map"
output: html_notebook

The purpose of this R markdown is to create an interactive map in Shiny

I'm using this [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) website as a guide.
```{r}
#Set up the workspace

rm(list = ls())
library(dplyr)
library(leaflet)
library(maptools)
library(rgdal)
library(tidyr)
```
How do we load shapefiles? Use maptools
Got data from NYS as shapefiles.  

Step 1 is that we need to set the projection. We have data as projected, NAD_1983_UTM_Zone_18N with a geogcs of GCS_North_American_1983
```{r}
A2A<-readOGR("Map/A2ACorridor.shp", layer = "A2ACorridor")
str(A2A@data)
Forests<-readOGR("Data/Study Forest Locations.shp", layer = "Study Forest Locations")
```

First we need to do a spatial transform to get lat/long into the projection.

```{r}
A2A_proj<-spTransform(A2A, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
Forests_proj<-spTransform(Forests, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))
Forests_copy<-Forests_proj
```
Now try to plot
```{r}

leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% 
  setView(lng = -75.05, lat = 44.05, zoom = 7) %>% 
  addPolygons(
    data = Forests_proj, 
    weight = 5, 
    col = 'red',
    highlight = highlightOptions(#highlight lets you mouse over a county and have it change color
      weight = 5,
      color = "orange", 
      bringToFront = T))


```
Great! It works!

Now bring in some data about the detections

```{r}
data<- read.csv("~/Documents/Kate_ThesisCode/dataFinal.csv")

#Need to summarize the data so that per species there is the total count per forest 
# dat_sum<-data %>% group_by(ForestName) %>% summarise(
#   HUMAN = sum(data$choice == "HUMAN"),
#   DEERWHITETAILED = sum(data$choice == "DEERWHITETAILED"),
#   CHIPMUNK = sum(data$choice == "CHIPMUNK"),
#   COYOTE = sum(data$choice == "COYOTE"),
#   SOMETHINGHERE = sum(data$choice == "SOMETHINGHERE"),
#   FISHER = sum(data$choice == "FISHER"),
#   COTTONTAILRABBIT = sum(data$choice == "COTTONTAILRABBIT"),
#   NOTHINGHERE = sum(data$choice == "NOTHINGHERE"), 
#   RACCOON = sum(data$choice == "RACCOON"),
#   GROUSERUFFED = sum(data$choice == "GROUSERUFFED"),
#   SQUIRRELRED = sum(data$choice == "SQUIRRELRED"),
#   BLUEJAY = sum(data$choice == "BLUEJAY"),
#   OTHERSMALLMAMMAL = sum(data$choice == "OTHERSMALLMAMMAL"),
#   OTHERBIRD = sum(data$choice == "OTHERBIRD"),
#   OPOSSUM = sum(data$choice == "OPOSSUM"),
#   SQUIRRELGRAY = sum(data$choice == "SQUIRRELGRAY"),
#   BLACKBEAR = sum(data$choice == "BLACKBEAR"),
#   TURKEY = sum(data$choice == "TURKEY"),
#   DOMESTICCAT = sum(data$choice == "DOMESTICCAT"),
#   DOMESTICDOG = sum(data$choice == "DOMESTICDOG"),
#   FOXRED = sum(data$choice == "FOXRED"),
#   PORCUPINE = sum(data$choice == "PORCUPINE"),
#   BOBCAT = sum(data$choice == "BOBCAT"),
#   WEASEL = sum(data$choice == "WEASEL"),
#   SKUNKSTRIPED = sum(data$choice == "SKUNKSTRIPED"),
#   SQUIRRELFLYING = sum(data$choice == "SQUIRRELFLYING"),
#   SNOWSHOEHARE = sum(data$choice == "SNOWSHOEHARE"),
#   CROWORRAVEN = sum(data$choice == "CROWORRAVEN"),
#   OWL = sum(data$choice == "OWL"),
#   GOOSEWILD = sum(data$choice == "GOOSEWILD"),
#   RIVEROTTER = sum(data$choice == "RIVEROTTER"),
#   MINK = sum(data$choice == "MINK")
# )


dat_sum<-data %>% group_by(ForestName, choice) %>% summarise(
  number_det = n()
)

deer<-filter(dat_sum, choice == "DEERWHITETAILED")
#Need to subset by species (which will happen in Shiny) 
```

Let's try joining to the shapefile using the `@data` call.

```{r}
Forests_proj@data <- left_join(Forests_proj@data, deer, by = c("ForestCode"= "ForestName"))

pal <- colorNumeric("Blues", domain= deer$number_det, alpha = TRUE) 
```

Now can I add those data to the map?
```{r}
library(htmltools)
labels<-sprintf( "%s, Number of Detections %s", 
                 Forests$ForestCode,Forests_proj$number_det) %>% lapply(htmltools::HTML)

```
And now try to display
```{r}

leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% 
  setView(lng = -75.169395, lat = 44.595466, zoom = 8) %>%  
  addPolygons(
     data = Forests_proj, 
     fillColor = ~pal(deer$number_det),
     fillOpacity = 0.5,
    weight = 2, 
    col = 'red',
    highlight = highlightOptions(#highlight lets you mouse over a county and have it change color
      weight = 5,
      color = "orange", 
      bringToFront = T),
    label = labels,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      style = list("font-weight" = "normal", padding = "3px 8px"),
      textsize = "15px",
      direction = "auto")
    ) 
    
```
It works!

```
